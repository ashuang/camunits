><P
>&#13;    libcam is a device independent library for image acquisition and
    processing.  A major design point of libcam is to provide a very simple
    API that allows an image processing routine to operate without any code
    modifications on any image source, whether it be a Firewire camera, USB
    camera, or logged data.  A second design point is to provide a framework
    (i.e. set of classes and utilities) to assist rapid development of image
    processing and machine vision algorithms.  This framework includes
    colorspace conversion and image compression routines, UI widgets, and
    visualization tools.
</P

>&#13;    libcam is motivated by the current state of image acquisition libraries.
    To date, writing a program to process and work with images is a much
    more complicated procedure than it needs to be.  Camera manufacturers
    often distribute proprietary development kits for working with their
    cameras, which means a program written for one camera is not likely to
    work with a camera from a different manufacturer.  Standards have been
    developed to alleviate this problem, such as the IEEE 1394 Digital Camera
    and USB Video Class specifications.  While these standards help on the
    driver side, there is still no standard device-independent API for image
    sources.  Finally, for machine vision researchers, recording a single
    dataset and being able to re-run their algorithms on that same data set
    over and over again is a desirable feature that is not supported in any
    major API.
</P
><P
>&#13;    libcam addresses these problems by providing a simple, general, and useful
    abstraction for image sources.  It was developed and used by Team MIT in
    the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge<A

    In that context, libcam provided a
    framework for processing high resolution images (5 cameras, 752x480 Bayer
    @ 22.8 fps) to achieve real time vision-based lane detection and tracking
    on an autonomous vehicle in an urban setting.  This tutorial provides an
    introduction to programming with libcam, and describes the various ways
    that libcam can be used in an image processing application.
