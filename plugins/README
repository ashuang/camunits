This directory contains Camunits plugins that are not part of the main Camunits
distribution, but are hosted in the Camunits svn repository for the convenience
of the Camunits developers.

Plugins hosted in this directory:
  - may not be as well supported or documented as those in the main Camunits
    distribution.  
  - may be distributed under a different license than the main Camunits 
    distribution.
  - may (probably will) have external third party dependencies.
  - may have intellectual property restrictions.
