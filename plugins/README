This directory contains libcam plugins that are not part of the main libcam
distribution, but are hosted in the libcam svn repository for the convenience
of the libcam developers.

Plugins hosted in this directory:
  - may not be as well supported or documented as those in the main libcam
    distribution.  
  - may be distributed under a different license than the main libcam 
    distribution.
  - may (probably will) have external third party dependencies.
  - may have intellectual property restrictions.
