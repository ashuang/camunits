    http://lcm.googlecode.com


The plugins provided in this package are:

    LCM.Publish
        Publishes images using the LCM interprocess-communications library.

    input.LCM
        Receives images published by LCM.Publish

Installation
============

To install from subversion:
    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make 
    $ make install

To install from a tarball (.tar.gz):
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

Notes
=====

For images of any reasonable resolution, you must configure your operating
system kernel to use larger UDP receive buffers.  Otherwise, you will observe a
large number of dropped frames.  A 2MB receive buffer is sufficient for VGA
resolution cameras, although you may want to experiment with this number on
your own system.

For more information on configuring the kernel UDP receive buffer maximum size,
see the LCM documentation (http://lcm.googlecode.com) or the 29west.com 
article [1].
