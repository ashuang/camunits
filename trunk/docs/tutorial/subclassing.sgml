    <title>Creating Custom Units -- Subclassing <classname>CamUnit</classname> and <classname>CamUnitDriver</classname></title>

    <para>
        This chapter describes some of the more advanced features of the Camunits
        framework.  Specifically, it describes how to create subclasses of
        <classname>CamUnit</classname> that can also be inserted into
        image processing chains and used in conjunction with other units.
        <note><title>Note</title>
        <para>
        While we believe strongly in building image procesing elements as
        subclasses of <classname>CamUnit</classname>,
        undertaking the creation of a <classname>CamUnit</classname>
        requires a much deeper understanding of how the Camunits library works than does
        simply using the output of an image processing chain.  
        Productively using Camunits in an image processing application
        does not require one to build custom units.  Specifically, one can
        choose to use Camunits primarily as an image acquisition and colorspace
        conversion tool.  We encourage readers to look at the three features
        mentioned next, and then decide if they are worth the investment of
        learning how to create custom units.

        Building a custom unit provides three main features.

                    <para>
                        In our experience, most image processing 
                        and image acquisition methods have some set of
                        controls and parameters that can be adjusted to affect
                        the output images. These parameters could be window
                        sizes, thresholds, scale factors, etc.  Playing with
                        hard-coded constants is often slow and tedious.
                        Using a GUI toolkit to implement widgets that control
                        the parameters is useful, but involves highly
                        repetetive code and is often tedious.

                    <para>
                        The <classname>CamUnit</classname> base class provides
                        a control API that allows subclasses to easily add
                        controls and parameters.  These controls can be
                        accessed and modified programmatically just as easily
                        as hard-coded parameters.  Additionally,
                        when a <classname>CamUnit</classname> is used with
                        the Camunits GTK widgets (e.g.
                        <classname>CamUnitControlWidget</classname> and
                        <classname>CamUnitChain</classname>), 
                        GUI elements are automatically created that allow
                        users to adjust the exposed controls in real-time.

                    <para>
                        In short, <classname>CamUnit</classname> 
                        simplifies the process of exposing controls for an
                        image processing element.  These controls are
                        accessible programmatically for applications without a
                        GUI, and they are also accessible in GUI form for
                        applications that use the Camunits GTK widgets.

                        When developing an image processing application, a
                        common and very useful debugging technique is to
                        visualize the intermediate or final stages of an
                        algorithm by rendering into the input image.  For
                        example, a face detector might circle the detected
                        faces, an optical flow algorithm might draw flow
                        vectors, etc.  Camunits provides a framework for
                        integrating visualization routines into an image
                        processing element.  Subclasses of
                        <classname>CamUnit</classname> can override virtual
                        methods that will be automatically invoked when the
                        application uses a
                        <classname>CamUnitChainGLWidget</classname>.  This
                        widget takes care of setting up an OpenGL context, and
                        instructs each unit in a chain to render whatever
                        visualization it deems useful.

                        We have specifically
                        chosen OpenGL because it is a widely used, stable
                        API that is both easy to use and has been implemented
                        on all major platforms.  Although OpenGL is typically
                        used in the context of 3D applications, it does
                        provide a highly developed and mature API for 2D
                        rendering.

                        This last bit almost need not be mentioned, but I'll
                        say it for emphasis.  By conforming to the

                        consists primarily of an object that is capable of
                        producing or processing images, an image processing
                        element becomes much more portable.  This is
                        especially true for image processing elements that
                        transform their input into another image, such as
                        colorspace conversion units, convolution filters,
                        radial undistortion, etc.

        <title>The GObject Type System</title>

        <para>
            Camunits is written in C, which was not designed specifically for
            object-oriented programming techniques.  The GObject type system,
            included with GLib, is essentially an object-oriented programming
            framework designed in C.  It makes heavy use of C structs and
            function pointers, provides run-time type-safety, virtual methods,
            interfaces, single-inheritance, and most of the features one would
            normally expect from an object-oriented framework.
        </para>
        <para>
            While GObject is robust and mature, it can also be awkward to
            use in C.  We'll be completely honest here -- boilerplate code and
            nested macros abound in GObject.  It does have a learning curve,
            and it can be easy to become mired in the implementation details,
            but once you've made it past the few dozen lines of boilerplate
            needed to implement an object, everything else is pretty
            straightforward.  For more information, see the <ulink
                url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/">GObject
                Reference Manual</ulink> or the

            This tutorial will not focus on trying to explain how GObject
            works.  For the most part, when we have to deal with the GObject
            type system in this tutorial, we'll say something like, "just do
            it this way" and expect that if you really want to know why,
            you'll go look at the GObject documentation<footnote><para><ulink

                            particular type might be available.  For example,
                            a unit driver for Video4Linux devices would

                            corresponding to image processing elements will
                            typically offer one unit.

            This example demonstrates how to create an image processing unit 
            that takes images as input, transforms each input image in some way,
            and then produces a modified image as output.  The output of this

            <para>
                Before jumping into the code, let's note a few things about
                naming conventions.  In addition to putting an object-oriented
                programming framework into C via a careful usage of structs,
                macros, and function pointers, we are also retrofitting C with
                a namespacing scheme<footnote><para><ulink
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace_%28programming%29#Emulating_namespaces">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace_(programming)#Emulating_namespaces</ulink></para></footnote>.  Although C does not inherently support
                namespaces, we can achieve some of the benefits of a properly
                namespaced language by following careful naming rules.  Camunits
                follows the GLib namespacing conventions and recommends
                the same for other applications that use Camunits.
            </para>
            <para>
                The first step in adhering to these namespacing guidelines is
                to choose a namespace.  GLib chose "g", GTK chose "gtk", and
                Camunits chose "cam".  The example filter uses the namespace
                "my".  The rules for naming functions, macros, and structs
                with this namespace are then:

                This is all required boilerplate, most of which should be

                Here, we forward-declare two structs.
                <classname>MyFilterExample</classname> will be the class
                definition struct, which is what most C++ programmers
                think of when they're defining the contents of a class in a
                header file.
                <classname>MyFilterExampleClass</classname> will be the class

                This constitutes the nastiest part of our boilerplate.  This
                is all GObject macro magic that will eventually make it easier
                to do runtime type checking.  For now, just do a search and
                replace, swapping out the namespace and class names
                accordingly.

                These two struct definitions correspond to the class
                definition and vtable, mentioned above.  The first struct,
                <literal>struct _MyFilterExample</literal>, is what most C++
                programmers would think of in a class definition.  The first
                member of this struct <emphasis>must</emphasis> be
                "<literal>CamUnit parent;</literal>".  After that, feel free to
                declare any member variables needed in the custom unit.
            </para>
            <para>
                The next struct, <literal>struct
                _MyFilterExampleClass</literal>, primarily defines the virtual
                methods for the class.  Unless your class will itself be a
                superclass and provide virtual methods not defined in Camunits,
                just rename the struct and leave it alone.

                The last part of header file consists of method definitions.
                Every GObject type always has a type retrieval method, named
                <literal>xx_yy_zz_get_type</literal>.  In this case, it's
                named <literal>my_filter_example_get_type</literal>.  Rename

                Next, our example unit defines two constructors.  One is the
                constructor for the actual unit, the second is the constructor
                for the unit driver.  Finally, we close the header with the
                GLib macro <function>G_END_DECLS</function> for C++
                portability, and close the original

                The <filename>.c</filename> file starts off with some

                this is an admittedly cryptic macro invocation of
                <function>G_DEFINE_TYPE</function>, which generates much
                of the boilerplate needed to add a new type to the GObject
                type system.  Exactly what it expands to is not important, but
                there are a few bits worth noting.  First, the macro
                forward-declares two functions that we must define later on:  
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
    static void my_filter_example_init (MyFilterExample *self);
    static void my_filter_example_class_init (MyFilterExampleClass *klass);
]]>
</programlisting>
                The function <function>my_filter_example_init</function> is
                the instance initializer, and is analagous, but not identical
                to a C++ constructor.  The major difference is that it never
                takes any parameters.
                <function>my_filter_example_class_init</function> is the class
                initializer, which is typically not explicitly seen in other
                object oriented programming languages.  Both of these will be
                explained in a more detail further on.  For an even more
                thorough explanation, see the GObject documentation and
                tutorial<footnote><para><ulink
                            url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/2.12/howto-gobject-construction.html">http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/2.12/howto-gobject-construction.html</ulink></para></footnote>.
                In addition to forward-declaring these two macros,
                <function>G_DEFINE_TYPE</function> also defines a static
                global variable that we will use later:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
    static void * my_filter_example_parent_class = NULL;
]]>
</programlisting>

                This variable is a pointer to the parent class of the newly
                defined type that will be populated automatically by the
                GObject type system.  It will be used to override
                virtual methods of the parent class, and also to directly
                invoke parent class methods that we have overriden.
            </para>
            <para>
                Finally, the <function>G_DEFINE_TYPE</function> macro defines
                the function <function>my_filter_example_get_type</function>,
                which was declared in <filename>filter_example.h</filename>.
                This function is primarily used by the GObject type system for
                runtime type checking and registration.  Lots of stuff for a
                single macro invocation, right?  It's natural for many
                programmers to shudder at all of the hidden complexity, but
                that really is the bulk of it.  Moving on to the rest of the
                file, we have:

                This is the constructor for the unit driver.  As mentioned
                earlier in this chapter, drivers for image processing units
                typically offer exactly one unit.  To reduce complexity,
                Camunits provides a default constructor for creating one of
                these "stock" drivers.  The result of invoking
                <function>cam_unit_driver_new_stock</function> with these
                parameters is a driver that always has one unit available with
                unit id "filter.example", a human-readable name of "Example",
                and that has no special flags.  Lastly, the constructor for
                the stock unit is passed to the stock driver.  This will be
                used by the stock driver when it is requested to create
                instances of the new unit.

                In this next section of code, we forward-declare several
                functions, and then define the class initializer.  The class
                initializer has two primary responsibilities.  First, it sets
                up the class virtual method table, overriding methods of the
                parent class when necessary.  In this example, our new class
                overrides the <methodname>on_input_frame_ready</methodname>
                method of its parent class.  It also overrides the destructor,
                which is a virtual method of the base class
                <classname>GObject</classname>
            </para>
            <para>
                The second responsibility of the class initializer is
                to define new signals that instances of the class will emit.
                For example, <classname>CamUnit</classname> provides the
                "frame-ready" signal, which is defined in its class
                initializer.  Our filter class does not have any new signals,
                but does inherit all of the signals from its parent classes.

</programlisting>

                Here, we define the constructor of our new class.  Unlike most
                object-oriented programming languages, the constructor in
                GObject is split up into multiple methods.  At the core is the
                instance initializer
                <function>my_filter_example_init</function>, which is required
                to initialize an instance to a reasonable default state
                without using any constructor arguments.  This initializer is
                not publicly exposed, and is never invoked directly by
                programs.  It is instead invoked as a result of the external
                constructor, <function>my_filter_example_new</function>
                calling <function>g_object_new</function>.  
            </para>
            <para>
                The external constructor is allowed to accept arguments.  The
                idea is that it will first create an instance of the class
                that has been initialized to valid defaults via the instance
                initializer.  Next, it can adjust the instance according to
                the arguments passed in.  In our example, the external
                constructor does not accept any arguments, and so it simply
                returns the result of the instance initializer.  In general,
                subclasses of <classname>CamUnit</classname> will not have
                constructors that take arguments, so this so this paragraph is
                mostly pedagogical.
            </para>
            <para>
                In terms of actual work accomplished in our constructor, our
                example does two things.  First, it creates a single integer
                control with id "patch-intensity" and human readable name "Patch
                Intensity".  The control value is allowed to range from 0 to
                255 with default increments of 1.  Its initial value is 127,
                and it is enabled by default.
            </para>
            <para>
                Second, our constructor connects to a signal emitted by our
                own intsance: the "input-format-changed" signal.  This signal
                fires whenever the input format to our unit changes.  We will
                use this signal handler later on to adjust the available
                outputs produced by our unit.

    // invoke the superclass destructor
    G_OBJECT_CLASS (my_filter_example_parent_class)->finalize(obj);
}
]]>
</programlisting>

                After the constructor, we define the destructor.  We will
                define it in almost exactly the same manner we would define a
                C++ destructor.  First, the child class releases any system
                resources and heap memory it has allocated.  In our cases,
                there are none.  Next, the child class invokes the destructor
                of its parent class.

// this method is called whenever the input unit produces a frame
static void
on_input_frame_ready (CamUnit *super, const CamFrameBuffer *inbuf, 
        const CamUnitFormat *infmt)
{
    MyFilterExample *self = MY_FILTER_EXAMPLE(super);

]]>
</programlisting>

                Finally, we get to the meat of the unit!  As seen in the class
                initializer, we have overriden the
                <function>on_input_frame_ready</function> method of the parent
                class.  This function is called whenever the input of our unit
                produces a frame via the "frame-ready" signal.  The three
                arguments passed to this method are the unit itself, a pointer
                to the framebuffer containing the actual image data, and a
                pointer to a unit format struct describing how the image data
                is formatted.

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
    CamFrameBuffer *outbuf = 
        cam_framebuffer_new_alloc (super->fmt->max_data_size);

    cam_pixel_copy_8u_generic (inbuf->data, infmt->row_stride,
            outbuf->data, super->fmt->row_stride,
            0, 0, 0, 0, infmt->width, infmt->height, 
            cam_pixel_format_bpp (infmt->pixelformat));
]]>
</programlisting>
                Worth noting is that the input framebuffer is
                <literal>const</literal>, and so must not be modified by our
                unit.  The first action taken by our unit is to allocate a new
                framebuffer to store the output image.  The superclass member
                variable <varname>fmt</varname> stores the output format that
                our unit has been initialized to, so we can use that to
                construct our output framebuffer accordingly.  Next, our
                example makes a bitwise copy of the input image into our
                output buffer.
                

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
    // draw a little rectangle
    int x0 = super->fmt->width / 4;
    int x1 = x0 * 3;
    int rw = x1 - x0;
    int y0 = super->fmt->height / 4;
    int y1 = y0 * 3;

    int val = cam_unit_control_get_int (self->patch_intensity_control);

    int i;
    for (i=y0; i<y1; i++) {
        memset (outbuf->data + i*super->fmt->row_stride + x0*3, val, rw*3);
    }
]]>
</programlisting>
                These are the actual guts of our unit -- drawing a rectangle
                into the image.  We have a trivial example demonstrating how
                to retrieve the value of a control, and then using that value
                to affect the output.

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

    // copy the timestamp and metadata dictionary
    cam_framebuffer_copy_metadata (outbuf, inbuf);

    outbuf->bytesused = super->fmt->row_stride * super->fmt->height;

    cam_unit_produce_frame (super, outbuf, super->fmt);
    g_object_unref (outbuf);
}
]]>
</programlisting>
                
                Finally, we close the method by setting the metadata of the
                output framebuffer, and calling the
                <function>cam_unit_produce_frame</function> method, which
                triggers the "frame-ready" signal of our unit.  This is a
                synchronous signalling framework, so by the time
                <function>cam_unit_produce_frame</function> returns, all other
                signal handlers that have subscribed to this unit will have
                completed.  This means that we can now release the memory
                allocated for the framebuffer.  Since GObject uses reference
                counting for its memory management, we decrement the reference
                count of the framebuffer to free its contents.

    // first, clear all available output formats from this unit
    cam_unit_remove_all_output_formats (super);

    // If there is no input, then we can't produce output.  
    if (!infmt) return;
   
    // actually, we can only handle 8-bit RGB input data.

</programlisting>

                The last step in our example is to define the function that
                will be invoked when the input to our unit changes.  We have
                created our unit to be able to process 8-bit RGB images of
                arbitrary sizes, so whenever the input to our unit changes, we
                must verify that our unit is able to process the new input
                format.
            </para>
            <para>
                Note that it is possible for the argument
                <varname>infmt</varname> to be <literal>NULL</literal>.  This
                will happen when there literally is no input.  In that case,
                our unit cannot produce output when it has no input so it
                simply does not define any available output formats.  In any
                other case, when it determines that its input is 8-bit RGB, it
                defines a single output format that matches the dimensions and
                row stride of its input.

                So far we have demonstrated how to create the filter example,
                but not how to actually use it in a Camunits application.  This
                process is actually pretty simple, and the only change we must
                make to an existing Camunits application is to register the
                new driver with the unit manager used by the application.

            <para>
                If we create a new <classname>CamUnitChain</classname> using
                the default constructor, then the chain creates its own
                internal unit manager.  To register the new filter with the
                unit manager, you can use the method
                <methodname>cam_unit_manager_add_driver</methodname>:

]]>
</programlisting>

                After this, the chain is able to create instances of the unit
                (via the unit manager) by invoking
                <methodname>cam_unit_chain_add_unit_by_id</methodname> and
                passing it the ID of our new unit -- "filter.example".
