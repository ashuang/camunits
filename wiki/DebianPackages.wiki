#summary Debian packages for libcam

=Debian packages are not updated very often=

=For the latest release, use the .tar.gz downloads=

== Debian / Ubuntu ==

Debian and Ubuntu packages for libcam are available for x86 and amd_64.  There's a chance that I haven't built libcam for a particular distribution or architecture.  This is mostly because of my limited access to development machines.  If you need one that's not yet built, let me know and I'll try to build one.  Otherwise, you can install from source. _--albert_

First, make sure you have Albert's sources file.
