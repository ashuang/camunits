=== How does libcam compare with !OpenCV? ===

Firstly, libcam is not a competitor with !OpenCV.  They accomplish different goals in the same field, and it is perfectly reasonable and encouraged to use both libcam and !OpenCV in the same application.

libcam differs from !OpenCV in two major aspects.  The first is that libcam is a framework for developing image acquisition and processing algorithms and applications, whereas !OpenCV provides a collection of already developed algorithms.  libcam is intended to simplify both the process of exposing and experimenting with parameters for machine vision algorithms, and the process of visualizing and debugging the result of such algorithms.

Secondly, within this framework, libcam places great importance on a simple way to acquire images and control image acquisition and processing elements.  In contrast, while !OpenCV does provide some image acquisition support, this support is fairly rudimentary and does not expose much of the functionality that most cameras provide.

In short, libcam is designed to streamline the process of developing both image processing _algorithms_ and _applications_, and provides some core functionality for doing so;  !OpenCV is primarily a collection of pre-developed algorithms available for use.  It will often be the case that an application developed using libcam will have great use for a specific algorithm provided by !OpenCV.

=== Why is libcam written in C and not C++? ===

Simplicity and portability.

 * C++ is a complex language with many features that we do not need in libcam.  We do not need templates, smart pointers, operator and function overloading, multiple inheritance, etc.  libcam uses a straightforward single-inheritance class hierarchy, which is not too difficult to achieve in C, especially when using !GLib.  At the end of the day, we simply do not need C++.

 * The complexities of C++ make it less portable than C.  Specifically, namespace mangling often makes it difficult to link against a C++ library compiled with a different compiler than the one you'd like to use.

 * Eventually, we would like to create language bindings for libcam so that it can be used directly in languages other than C.  For example, it would be quite useful to have Matlab bindings to allow matlab programs to use libcam directly.  C is the language of choice for this sort of application, and almost all major programming languages have a C API for creating these bindings.  While this is still possible in C++, it can be much more tedious.
