#summary Downloading and Installing libcam

== From Source ==

To install from source, replace _x.y.z_ with the latest version and:
{{{
wget http://libcam.googlecode.com/files/libcam-x.y.z.tar.gz
tar xzvf libcam-x.y.z.tar.gz
cd libcam-x.y.z
./configure
make
make install 
}}}

== Mac OS X ==

libcam 0.0.2 has been built and run successfully on Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard).  To build, you will need glib and gtk+ installed, which I suggest getting from [http://darwinports.com/ Darwinports].  After installing darwinports, run:
{{{
sudo port install glib2
sudo port install gtk2
}}}
to install the glib and gtk+.

IIDC camera support works if you have libdc1394-2.0.0-rc9 installed.  After installing libdc1394, you may need to run:
{{{
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
}}}
in order for the libcam ./configure script to detect libdc1394.

== Subversion ==

To stay on the bleeding edge of libcam development, you'll want to work from our subversion repositories hosted on Google Code.

You will want at least the following:
 * libjpeg62 development files
 * OpenGL development files
 * GLIB/GTK+ development files
 * autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool, m4)
 * gtk-doc
 * docbook

 # Checkout the repository
{{{
$ svn checkout http://libcam.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ libcam-read-only
}}}
 # setup the build scripts
{{{
$ cd libcam-read-only
$ gtkdocize --copy
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
}}}
 # (Optionally) mess with the source code
 # Build
{{{
make
}}}
 # Install (requires superuser privileges)
{{{
make install
}}}
