*Mar 11, 2009* - Release 0.2.0

This release features a wide-ranging API overhaul, and breaks the old API in
many ways.

  * Most classes have had all of their fields moved away from the public structs
  and into private structs.  This is so that future changes do not result in any
  API or ABI incompatibilities, and is in keeping with GTK+3 plans.  Currently,
  the only classes that still have publicly exposed fields in their structs are:
  !CamUnitFormat, !CamFrameBuffer
  * !CamUnitManager has been converted to follow a singleton pattern
  * !CamUnitControl has been modified so that enumerated controls no longer have
  integer values implicitly assigned by ordering.  integer values associated with 
  enumerated controls are now explicitly assigned, using arrays of
  !CamUnitControlEnumValue structs.
  * All core units have been converted to plugins.  All functions specific to
  core units have been removed from the API.
  * when adding an output format, max_data_size is no longer specified.
  * convert.to_rgb now uses IPP and Framewave JPEG decompression plugins from
  camunits-extra if they are available
  
*Camunits Core*

  * new functions:
    ** `cam_unit_manager_get_and_ref`
    ** `cam_unit_add_output_format`
    ** `cam_unit_control_get_enum_values`

    ** `cam_unit_set_name`
    ** `cam_unit_control_get_type_str` (renamed: `cam_unit_control_get_control_type_str`)
    ** all functions related to core units have been removed.

    * add FPS display, other minor UI tweaks
    * change "-f" option to "-c"
  * libcamunits:

    * !CamUnitManager bugfixes
  * libcamunits-gtk:
    * bugfixes in !UnitControlWidget
  * camlog
    * add "-c" option to load chain from XML description file
    * add "-o" option to specify output file

*Nov 11, 2008* - New project name, release 0.1.0

The [http://libcam.googlecode.com libcam] project is renamed to Camunits.  Reasons for the renaming are:
  # Avoid conflicting name with BSD libcam, a completely unrelated project.
  # Reduce confusion between the core library (libcamunit) and the whole project (libcamunit, libcamunit-gtk, camview, camlog, plugins, etc.)
  # Choose a new name that more closely reflects the core design.

To mark the new project name, version 0.1.0 is also being released.  Notable changes:

  * better support for 16-bit pixel formats
  * input_dc1394: include format7 mode in output format string
  * unit_manager: on failure to open plugin dir, warn in dbg instead of stderr
  * unit_chain:   store output format name in saved XML.
  * unit_control_widget: slightly smarter about format changing
  * minor bugfixes all around.

This release breaks the old API.  To port libcam code to Camunits code, 
replace all instances of "libcam" and "LIBCAM" with "camunits" and "CAMUNITS",
respectively.  This applies to source code, include paths, library names,
linker flags, environment variables, pkg-config names, etc.

The following two perl commands accomplish the search/replace:
{{{
   $ perl -pi -e "s/LIBCAM/CAMUNITS/g;" <files>
   $ perl -pi -e "s/libcam/camunits/g;" <files>
}}}
